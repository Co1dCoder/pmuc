## About

This project contains a reading library for the RVM file format and a command line utility that allows to convert RVM files to

- [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) in XML and binary (FI) encoding,
- [COLLADA](https://www.khronos.org/collada/) files,
- DSL3D language commands, and
- [IFC 2x3](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/).

## How to Build

### Prerequisites

On Unix and Linux, a g++ compiler >= 4.8 is required.
On Windows, you need at least Visual Studio 2012. Other platforms / compilers / IDEs have not been tested but are likely to work as well (please file an issue if not).

Building requires a [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) version >= 2.8.

### Dependencies

Most dependencies are included in git submodules, namely [eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), [OpenCOLLADA](https://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/OpenCOLLADA), and [xiot](https://github.com/Supporting/xiot). To inititalize the submodules, run:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Soley [boost](http://www.boost.org/) needs to be provided externally. On Linux it is sufficient to install the boost development package, e.g.:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

On other systems, let the environment varaible ``BOOST_ROOT```point to Boost root directory.

### Run the build

#### Windows

Run cmake from a different directory than your source (e.g. in a `build` folder) and select the generator of your choice, e.g.:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..

Open the generated IDE file (pmuc.sln) or start the build from command line:

    cmake --build . --target pmuc --config Release

#### Linux

Run:

    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build . --target pmuc

### Running Tests

PMUC includes a number of running tests that can be run from the build directory using `ctest`:

    ctest -C Release --output-on-failure
