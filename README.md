Dependencies
------------

The library itself only relies on the C++ standard library but the converter uses several open-source projects:
 - XIOT, a X3D/X3DB input/ouput library, https://github.com/Supporting/xiot
 - OpenCOLLADA, and more precisely its StreamWriter library, https://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/OpenCOLLADA
 - Eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra, http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

An optional dependency also exists on iconv for encoding translations, Windows users can find it at : http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm
