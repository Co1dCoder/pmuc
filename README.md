- [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) in XML and binary (FI) encoding,
- [COLLADA](https://www.khronos.org/collada/) files,

## How to Build

### Prerequisites

On Unix and Linux, a g++ compiler >= 4.8 is requires.
On Windows, you need at leas Visual Studio 2015. Other platforms / compilers / IDEs have not been tested but are likely to work as well (pls file an issue if not).

[biicode](https://www.biicode.com/) is required to download pmuc dependent libraries. Biicode also requires a [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) version < 3.0. 

On some platforms, all prequistes for biicode can be install running:
    bii setup:cpp

### Dependencies

Most dependencies are managed by biicode ([eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org), [OpenCOLLADA](https://collada.org/mediawiki/index.php/OpenCOLLADA), [xiot](https://github.com/Supporting/xiot), [IFCPlusPlus](https://github.com/ifcquery/ifcplusplus)) including their subdependencies. Soley a biicode package for libiconv is missing, thus we deliver windows versions with the pmuc repository (contrib folder). On Linux, the functionality of libiconv should be available in standrd libraries (when build-essentials have been installed). If not, try:

    sudo apt-get install libiconv-hook-dev

<!-- An optional dependency also exists on iconv for encoding translations, Windows users can find it at : http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm -->


### Run the build

To start the build, run

    bii buzz

from the root directory.
